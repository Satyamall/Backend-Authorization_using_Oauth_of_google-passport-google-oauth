# OAuth:-
 - OAuth is when applications who have large user base provide their authentication system to other applications so that they can have theuir customers authenticate through this 3rd party applications like FB, Google.
 - Advantage to the customer is he does not have to remember lots of passwords and if 1 application is compromised then he does not have to fear about his credentials being used on other applications that he has signed up for.
 - Security provided by FB or Google is much better then a normal small scale application so customer trusts those more than our application and from developer angle we do not have to build authentication systems ourselves and can achieve kind of password less systems.

# Authorization:-
 - Authorization comes after user authenticates and Authorisation determines which pages can a signed in user access.
 - This is also called as RBAC ( Role based access control ) and it helps in security also as some compromised credentials will not lead to the entire application being compromised.
